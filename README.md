Progress-Bar-Demo
=================

Optus Sample Test



Hi,

Thanks for the opportunity.
My name is Fred and I am very dedicated developer looking for an opportunity to further enhance my JavaScript Skills.

I have decided to use bootstrap to scaffold the solution. 
Simple jQuery functions were added into the progress-bar.js file.


Under the production quality folder, there are several considerations to take into account once deployed to production.

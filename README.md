Progress-Bar-Demo
=================

Optus Sample Test



Hi,

Thanks for the opportunity.
My name is Fred and I am very dedicated developer looking for an opportunity to further enhance my JavaScript Skills.

I have decided to use bootstrap to scaffold the solution. 
Simple jQuery functions were added into the progress-bar.js file.


About the prototype version
 - It is responsive
 - It works as requrired
 - It uses the boostrap components without requiring any external plugins or jQueryUi
 - It works on all browsers (some fine tweaks needed on ie7)

Under the production quality folder, there are several considerations to take into account once deployed to production.

Fred

Hi,

Thanks for the opportunity. I am very dedicated front end developer looking to learn more about MVC javascript frameworks.


I have decided to use bootstrap to scaffold the solution. 
Simple jQuery functions were added into the progress-bar.js file.


Under the production quality folder, there are several considerations to take into account once deployed to production.
